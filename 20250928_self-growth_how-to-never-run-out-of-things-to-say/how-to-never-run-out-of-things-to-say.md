# How to never run out of things to say

## Say what come to mind in 3 secs
After 3 secs, your filter kick in  
blurting out (speak out immedeately  
Dont anaylized which one in more interesting  

## Curiosity(genuie interest)
If someone mention their job, don’t jsut ask what they do and move on.
- What’s the most challenging part?
- How did you get started?
- What would surprise people about your industry?
> "People remeber how you made them feel, not what’s you said."

## The art of follow-up question
**listen -> identify details -> dig deeper**  
Don't jump to your experience too quickly  
Don't switch topic too quickly out of conversation anxiety  

How was your travel
- What’s your favorite city
- Was it the architecture that impressed you
> Single monologue? Don't be that person

## Conversation threading
Details provide more threading
Q: I felt so tired on clients.  
- When did you start working on it?
- Can anyone help you in this process?
- How they deal with difficult clients?

##The balance of depth and lightness
> The most engaging conversations are like a good movie
depth = connection  
lightness = enjoyment

## Recovery strategies for when your mind blanks
- current environment
- shared experiences
- simple curiousity
simply comment on somthing in your imediate surroundings  
foolproof: curious reversion

## The conversation emergency kit
Balance with universaility and uniqueness  
Common enough that anyone can answer, but interesting enough to generate engaged responses  
keep 5-7 of these at all time(it’s accessible for everyone)  

How do you do? => What’s been keeping you busy lately?  
How was the movie? => What’s shows are you curently watching that you would recommend?  
Have any trips planned? => If you could teleport anywhere for just 24 hours, where would you go?

## Self-disclosure
Through appropriate self-disclosure to create an opening for the other person to do the same  
Self-disclosure works through the princple of reciprocity
- slightly not dramatically
- from fact to feeling

## Perfect exit
A grateful exit leaves a positive final impression, and sets the stage for future interactions  
**Positive affitmation**: acknowledges the value of the interaction
- I really learn a lot in our conversaion
**Genuine reason**: provide a non-personal explanation for ending
- I need to head out for  another appointment
**Future bridge**: maintain the bridge beyond this single conversation
- I’m really interested in your works, maybe you could send me a link
remove the pressure to indefinitely sustain every exchange
